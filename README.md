# Weather

### Let's learn to code! 🚀

This is the completed application that will be built for Huge Codes. It's simple in scope - display the weather for a given city - but it covers many important concepts used in real-life software projects.

Since it is a *web* app, participants will be dealing with *web* technologies. However, the general knowledge required to complete the project is applicable to any other platform or environment.

### Run it 🏃

Download or clone this repository. You'll need node.js and npm installed. Once you've got everything, run this from the project folder:

```
npm i && npm start
```

You can then go to [http://localhost:3000]() to see it running.

🚨 If you don't know what this section means, don't worry. You'll know when you're done with Huge Codes. 🚨
